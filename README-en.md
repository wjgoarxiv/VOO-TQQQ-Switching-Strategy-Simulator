# VOO-TQQQ Switching Strategy Simulator

An interactive Streamlit web application for simulating smart investment strategies based on `VOO` and `TQQQ`, triggered by the market indices `IXIC` and `SPX`. This application allows users to predict actual investment outcomes based on these strategies.

## Project Overview

In this project, you can simulate the effectiveness of investment strategies that switch between `VOO` and `TQQQ`, using data from Yahoo Finance. Users can set their desired time period for the simulation to run.

## How to Use

1. Select the `Start Date` and `End Date` for the simulation. Please note, the start year must be set to 2011 or later.
2. Click on the `Run Simulation` button.
3. View the graph comparing the total asset value with the value if only salary was accumulated, and check the result table for detailed insights.

## Key Features

- **Run Simulation**: Simulate the performance of investment strategies over user-defined periods.
- **Result Visualization**: View intuitive graphs depicting the investment outcomes.
- **Result Table**: Receive detailed numeric results of the simulation in a tabular format.
